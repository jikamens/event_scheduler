"""Python Event Scheduler

Match event attendees with topics and time slots based on preferences.

Example::

  from event_scheduler import Scheduler

  s = Scheduler()

  # Time slots have arbitrary names.
  s.add_time_slot('9:30')
  s.add_time_slot('10:30')
  s.add_time_slot('11:30')
  etc.
  ... or ...
  s.add_time_slots('9:30', '10:30', '11:30')

  s.add_topic('Underwater basket-weaving',
              # Time slots and capacities
              (('9:30', 10), ('10:30', 10)))
  s.add_topic('Psychology of auto repair',
              (('10:30', 25), ('11:30', 25)))
  etc.

  s.add_attendee('John Doe', 'Acme, Inc.',
                 # Topic choices from most to least preferred
                 ('Underwater basket-weaving',
                  'History of yarn cultivation',
                  'Wasting time for fun and profit'))
  s.add_attendee('Jane Doe', 'Widgets LLC',
                 # Topic choices from most to least preferred
                 ('Managing the dual-career family',))
  etc.

  # It's a popular topic, but he asked nicely, so make sure he gets it.
  s.manually_assign('John Doe', 'History of yarn cultivation')

  # Where the magic happens
  s.schedule()

TODO
----

Pull requests welcome!

PyPI

Sphinx-ify documentation?

Manual assignment should include assignment to specific sessions.

It should be possible to specific specific time slots for attendees.

Overlapping time slots? Probably significantly more complicated.

There are circumstances when scheduling fails when it probably could
succeed with more aggressive efforts.

Different session-filling algorithms (e.g., fill sessions in order
rather than filling them evenly).

More formatting options for scheduling results.

Optionally ordering attendees by random shuffling rather than by name,
so that multiple runs of the scheduler yield different
assignments. This might also help to address "There are circumstances
when scheduling fails...", since it would enable the user to try to
schedule repeatedly until scheduling succeeds.

Support multiple sessions for a topic in a single time-slot.

Tests.

    Checkpointing makes it easier to experiment with different
    scheduling options. You can checkpoint the current state of
    assignments at any time, rollback to the last checkpoint you
    created, or commit the last checkpoint you created. Once you
    rollback or commit a checkpoint, you can then rollback or commit
    the one before that, etc. To prevent programming errors, the
    checkpoint's name must be specified when committing or rolling
    back.

        A best effort is made to schedule attendees to attend the
        topics they prefer.

        The scheduling algorithm as it is currently implemented is as
        follows:

        The first phase of scheduling is the time-slot phase, in which
        a pass is made through the attendees for each time-slot (e.g.,
        if there are three time-slots, then there will be three
        passes), and on each pass, an attempt is made to assign a
        session to each attendee whose schedule isn't already
        full. The time-slot phase works as follows:

        * Let n = number of passes in this phase
        * Let m = current pass of this phase, numbered from 0
        * Sort attendees by the sum of their top (n - m) unassigned
          preferences, then in reverse order by the sum of their
          position in prior passes, then by ``"{org} - {name}"`` for
          stability.
        * Skip attendees whose schedules are already full.
        * Try to assign a session to each attendee (see the
          documentation for the ``assign`` method).

        Next is the fill phase, in which we attempt to fill attendee
        schedules that aren't currently filled because the order in
        which sessions were assigned prevented us from assigning
        sessions for some attendees in some passes. See the
        documentation for the ``swap`` method for details on how this
        is done.

        Finally is the improve phase, where we attempt to move around
        assignments to improve the overall happiness of
        attendees. Again, see ``swap`` for additional details.

        Note that this algorithm and implementation don't try to
        create a "perfect" or "optimal" schedule. That's actually a
        pretty hard problem and I'm frankly not sure it's worth the
        effort. The goal is to make reasonably good assignments.
